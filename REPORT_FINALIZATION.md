# Report Finalization (Do This Before Submission)

I cannot guarantee or help bypass AI-detection checks.  
What I can do is help you submit a strong report that is clearly personalized and consistent with your code.

## Edit These Parts in `PROJECT_REPORT.md`
- Cover page details (name, roll no, guide, date).
- Declaration line (your wording/signature style).
- Challenges and learnings section (real issues you faced).
- Personal reflection block at the end (must be your own words).

## Add Proof of Work
- Add 5 screenshots from your running app.
- Add terminal snippet showing:
  - `npm run prisma:migrate -- --name init`
  - `npm run dev`
  - `npm test`
- Mention one bug you fixed during development and where in code.

## Keep Report and Code Aligned
- If you change any feature, update both report and README.
- Do not claim features that are not present in code.
